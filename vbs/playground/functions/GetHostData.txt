Function GetHostData(strSubNet)
	'
	' The purpose of this function is to build the data
	' that is passed to other Functions. It  will return
	' information via WMI from the localhost. 
	' Currently all that's needed is:
	'    Bios serialnumber
	'    IP address
	'    MAC address
	'    hostname
	'
	' I do plan on gathering information about the OS
	' and logged on user.
	'
	' This code has been reworked from the previous 
	' release, source:trunk/client/winmon-client.vbs
	'
	' In this release I have moved several things out 
	' to separate functions.
	'
	' Declare variables that are pulled from WMI
	'
	Dim strSerialNumber

	Dim strHostName

	' Declare variables that get built
	'

	'
	' Assign values to variables by calling Functions
	'
